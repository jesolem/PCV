## About PCV
PCV is a pure Python library for computer vision based on the book "Programming Computer Vision with Python" by Jan Erik Solem. 

More details on the book (and a pdf version of the latest draft) can be found at [programmingcomputervision.com](http://programmingcomputervision.com/).

### Dependencies
You need to have Python 2.6+ and as a minimum:

* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)

Some parts use:

* [SciPy](http://scipy.org/)

Many sections show applications that require smaller specialized Python modules. See the book or the individual examples for full list of these dependencies. 

### Structure

*PCV/*  the code.

*pcv_book/*  contains a clean folder with the code exactly as used in the book at time of publication.

*examples/*  contains sample code. Some examples use data available at [programmingcomputervision.com](http://programmingcomputervision.com/).
